# Using threads to run code simultaneously

A Rust program is run as a `process` by our Operating System. Within this program, we can have **parts that run independently and/or simultaneously**. Each of these running parts is called a `thread`. Splitting our program among multiple threads can improve performance, but also, we need to deal with some problems. We donâ€™t have any guarantee about the order in which these threads will run and finish. Problems -

- `Race conditions` - where threads are accessing a resource in an inconsistent order leading to an unpredictable outcome.
- `Deadlocks` - Multiple threads stuck waiting for each other to finish. Due to this, all those threads are blocked and cannot continue execution.

Creating a new thread -
```rust
thread::spawn(
	// passing a closure, containing the code to execute in this new thread
	| | {
		// code that will run in the worker thread
	}
)
```

> When the main thread is finished executing, all the other threads created by the program are forcefully shutdown, regardless of whether they finished executing or not.

We can `prevent premature shutdown of child threads` in this manner -
```rust
fn main( ) {
    let workerThread= thread::spawn(
        | | {
            //* code that will run in this worker thread */
        }
    );

    //* code that will run in the main thread */

	// this will block the main thread until the worker thread finishes execution
    workerThread.join( )
        .unwrap( );
}
```

## Using move closures with threads

If the worker thread wants to use a value from the parent thread, we need to add the `move` keyword with the closure being passed as the argument. This **moves the ownership of that value from the parent thread to the worker thread**. Here is an example -
```rust
fn main( ) {
    let vector= vec![ 1,2,3 ];

    let workerThread= thread::spawn(
        move | | {
            // ownership of `vector` moved to the worker thread
            println!("the vector is - {:?}", vector);
        }
    );

    // this will block the main thread until the worker thread finishes execution
    workerThread.join( )
        .unwrap( );
}
```

We need to move the ownership of *vector* from the main to the worker thread, because in this way, *vector* **cannot be dropped by the main thread while the worker thread is still using it**.
